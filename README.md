This is project is done for the Android Basics Nanodegree with Udacity. 

The project is about making a Tour Guide app. This is an app with multiple screens, each of which lists a kind of attraction for a given city, national park, or historical monument. 

You may choose to use explicit intents to move between activities, or you may choose to use a ViewPager combined with fragments.

Next, you'll fill in those lists with list items, populated using a custom adapter. It may make sense for some lists to include information such as a phone number or business hours, but for others it may make more sense to have a photograph. Design your adapter based on the information you would like to show.
